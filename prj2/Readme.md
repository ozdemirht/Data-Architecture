# Project: Effect of Weather on Restaurant Reviews

In this project, we are attempting to find out the impact of weather conditions on customersâ€™ review of restaurants. 
As input, 
<ol>
 <li> YELP data 
 <li> climate datasets for temperature and precipitation observations are from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) database. 
</ol>
<a href="http://www.snowflake.com" target='_blank'>Snowflake</a> is used as a cloud-native data warehouse system.
This project  architects and designs a Data Warehouse DWH for the purpose of reporting and online analytical processing (OLAP).

## Data Architecture 
This project comprise of three major steps;
<ol>
 <li> Loading files to staging area
 <li> Extracting data in files on staging area into tables in ODS
 <li> Transforming data in ODS to OLAP representations in DWH for reporting and analysis.  
</ol>

## Staging 
Project defines the following staging areas
<ol>
 <li> p2_json_stage for staging JSON files (according to p2_json_format file format)
 <li> p2_csv_stage for staging CSV files (according to p2_csv_format file format)
</ol>

## Operational Data Store (ODS)
The following ER diagram depicts the tables in ODS.

## Data Warehouse
The following flow is used to obtain a report having  the business name, temperature, precipitation, and ratings. All of these values are retrieved from dimension tables (dim_yelp_business, dim_climate_temperature, dim_climate_precipitation, dim_yelp_review) by using facts_review table in DWH schema.
